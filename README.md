# NX4832K035-KDO-Beta

These are the Nextion_Support directory files for the BETA version of the EA7KDO/KF6S 3.5 inch Enhanced Nextion screen on a Pi-Star based hotspot.

These files are NOT meant to be installed directly onto a hotspot.  They MUST be rerieved and placed in the proper location in Pi-Star via scripts and instructions contained in a seperate repository.

Once that's done, the screen itself can be used to grab future updates to the screen AND updates to the files in this repository.

Again, this is BETA.  Not for general use! Bugs are possible.
